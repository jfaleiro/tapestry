Tapestry is the foundation for distributed computing in QuantLET, supporting both data and CPU intensive use cases

## Data Fabric

Tapestryâ€™s data fabric supports fully replicated or partitioned mode on its native implementation

## Compute Grid

Tapestry compute grid solution is built around conventional map-reduce abstractions

### So, You Like Your Vendor?

No problem. In addition to the native back-end implementation, Tapestry works as an ideal abstraction layer for commercial solutions out there, including products like Coherence or GemFire.
